Magento_Cachewarmer
===================

Magento Cachewarmer (used for FPC)

Very simple program to load all known Magento pages and by doing so warming the cache (so the first hit is created)

1. Upload php script to your Magento installation in folder /shell (using FTP)

2. Open your webshop domain and add the URI /shell/cachewarmer.php
(wait a little)

3. And enjoy


CODING HELP APPRECIATED
=======================

Improvements can certainly be made

Open cachewarmer.php file and look for TODO

Help is very much appreciated
