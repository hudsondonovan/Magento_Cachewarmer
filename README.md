Magento Cachewarmer (used for FPC)

Very simple program to load all know Magento pages and by doing so warming the cache (so the first hit is created)

1. Upload php script to your Magento installation in folder /shell (using FPT)

2. Open your webshop domain and add /shell/cachewarmer.php
(wait a little)

3. And enjoy
